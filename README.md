# wikistyle
Custom stylesheets for the foswiki FI implementation. 

## TODO
- Set web BG color for each cluster
- Button alignment

- TL;DR http://foswiki/SCC/Software/Slurm so far a class for div named 'fiCheatsheetMessage'
- Ul / li style
- Search bar funkiness http://foswiki/Main/WebHome (edit inline)
- Color styling on internal notification boxes
- =text= is used to provide <code>text</code> Can we CSS it so that it does not break and is always on a single line?
- Style Table of contents
- Width of the actual content is a bit limited compared to previous version, this leads to more scrolling for pre elements. eg: modules page
- Private webs per center: where do they live? (aka subwebs of center? Or somewhere else? Where are the links to them? etc)
- Subwebs "expand" button on Web landing pages: more... is kind of hidden: replace by an icon?

## Done
- Underline doubles
- Footer freeze
- Hover brightness on search tab
- Remove writer names
- Logo size
